# Reduxing Reddit

Consuming Redux from a client web app that uses Redux for state management.


## Install

Enter the commands below in your terminal to get started:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/boilerplate-redux-async
mv boilerplate-redux-async async-redux-practice
cd async-redux-practice
npm install
npm start
```

If you would like to push changes back to your own repository, you'll need to create an empty repository in your GitHub and [change](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/) the `origin` remote to point to that repo:

```shell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/async-redux-practice
```


## Start with these

_As a user, I want to click a button and retrieve a list of post titles from the New Zealand subreddit so that I can read about what's going on in New Zealand._

<details><summary>Get some hints</summary>
 - This one is done for you! But take a look at it anyway and try to make sure you understand what's going on. In particular, identify:
   - the _action_ and _action creator_. Take a good look at `fetchPosts` in particular. What does it return?
   - the _reducer_
   - the _container_ and _presentation_ components
   - Notice that `LoadSubreddit` is a mixture of both container and presentation: it returns JSX, but it uses `react-redux`'s `connect` function to wire up the `dispatch` allowing it to fire off an _action_.
   - The dev tools setup is a little different when you're using middleware: check out the [docs](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) for more details.
</details>

_As a user, I want to be able to enter a new subreddit to view the titles from so that I can see what else is happening on Reddit._
 - Initially, the subreddit is hardcoded into `LoadSubreddit`. If you put the current subreddit in the store, you'll be able to change it using actions...

_As a user, I want to view not just the title, but also a date and time and a short summary of each post so that I can preview the content._


## Try these next

_As a user, I want to see a loading spinner while my posts are being retrieved so that I get some feedback that the app is working._
 - You'll need to dispatch an action _before_ you send the request to Reddit.

_As a user, I want to be informed when there's an error retrieving my posts so that I don't sit there looking at a blank page._
 - The error handling is fairly non-existent in the boilerplate. Try setting up an action to dispatch when there's a problem.

_As a user, I want to incorporate another API and I don't care which one! So that I can, y'know, have another API to look at._
 - Take the opportunity to practice the process by retrieving data from another API using async actions. Use the same overall structure, returning a thunk from your action creator.


## Stretch

_As a user, I want to be able to sort the list of posts by title and post date so that I can organise my results._

_As a user, I want to be able to sort in both ascending and descending order so that I can see the start and end of the list._

_As a user, I want to filter the list of posts based on a search that I type so that I can find the post I'm looking for._
